## ‚ú® About The Project

Ever wanted to get the summary of a long lecture, find a specific topic in a tutorial, or understand the key arguments of a podcast without watching the entire video? This extension is the solution.

By leveraging YouTube's internal API to reliably fetch transcripts and connecting to the powerful language understanding of ChatGPT, this tool transforms passive video watching into an interactive Q&A session.

### Key Features

- **Reliable Transcript Extraction:** Uses YouTube's internal InnerTube API to fetch transcripts, making it more robust than traditional web scrapers.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Ask questions in a clean, modern, dark-themed chat window and get instant answers.
- **Powered by ChatGPT:** Integrates with the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-Turbo) for intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Secure API Key Storage:** Your OpenAI API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never shared.
- **Markdown Support:** The bot's responses are beautifully formatted with lists, bolding, and more for easy readability.
- **User-Friendly UX:** Includes loading animations for feedback, a welcome message, and a copy-to-clipboard button for the bot's answers.

## üôè Acknowledgments

-   Inspiration for the final transcript extraction method came from the [yt-transcript.js script](https://gist.github.com/iulian-onofrei/9e37b39b972304da1a2729a6338b816a) and the associated [Medium article](https://medium.com/@aqib-2/extract-youtube-transcripts-using-innertube-api-2025-javascript-guide-dc417b762f49).
